𝐃𝐚𝐲 𝟐: 𝟑𝟎 𝐃𝐚𝐲𝐬 𝐨𝐟 𝐉𝐚𝐯𝐚𝐒𝐜𝐫𝐢𝐩𝐭 - 𝐎𝐩𝐞𝐫𝐚𝐭𝐨𝐫𝐬 𝐓𝐚𝐤𝐞 𝐂𝐨𝐧𝐭𝐫𝐨𝐥!

Yesterday, we explored the building blocks of JavaScript: variables and data types. Today, we're diving into operators, the essential tools that manipulate and control our data!

𝐎𝐩𝐞𝐫𝐚𝐭𝐨𝐫𝐬 are special symbol  that perform various operations on operand like variables and values. JavaScript offers a robust set of operators, including:

🔢 𝐀𝐫𝐢𝐭𝐡𝐦𝐞𝐭𝐢𝐜 𝐎𝐩𝐞𝐫𝐚𝐭𝐨𝐫𝐬 (+, -, *, /, %): Perform basic mathematical calculations.

⚖️ 𝐂𝐨𝐦𝐩𝐚𝐫𝐢𝐬𝐨𝐧 𝐎𝐩𝐞𝐫𝐚𝐭𝐨𝐫𝐬 (==, !=, <, >, <=, >=): Compare values and return true or false based on the comparison.

🔗 𝐋𝐨𝐠𝐢𝐜𝐚𝐥 𝐎𝐩𝐞𝐫𝐚𝐭𝐨𝐫𝐬 (&&, ||, !): Combine conditions for complex logic (AND, OR, NOT).

✍️ 𝐀𝐬𝐬𝐢𝐠𝐧𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭 𝐎𝐩𝐞𝐫𝐚𝐭𝐨𝐫𝐬 (=, +=, -=, *=, /=): Assign values and perform calculations simultaneously (e.g., x += 5 is equivalent to x = x + 5).

🔄 𝐈𝐧𝐜𝐫𝐞𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭/𝐃𝐞𝐜𝐫𝐞𝐦𝐞𝐧t Operators (++, --): Increase or decrease a variable's value by 1 (pre-increment/decrement vs. post-increment/decrement have subtle differences).

Understanding these operators is crucial for controlling the flow of your JavaScript code. Keep experimenting and practicing to master their use!
